### About
Ranked Bedwars is one of the most popular and well-established communities for Minecraft and Hypixel—being home to over 30,000 players.

The flagship gamemode, Ranked Bedwars, involves two teams of four players. Using custom rules and map limitations, Ranked Bedwars aims to create a unique competitive experience—rewarding high-skilled players using a fair rating algorithm.

Ranked Bedwars has grown to become a leading community for both Minecraft and Hypixel.

### Development Team
Ranked Bedwars is ran by a team of dedicated volunteers. Starting with humble origins, Ranked Bedwars has since grown exponentially. As such, we've had to develop and adapt our systems to be able to handle such immense growth.

Today, Ranked Bedwars crafts industry-leading systems utilising cutting-edge technologies like distributed computing, data analytics, and real-time communication.
